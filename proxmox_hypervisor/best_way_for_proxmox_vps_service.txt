Hi,
I was thinking about some fun project to do and it come to my mind of an idea of using Proxmox VE as VPS provider. I know this was done many times before and there are many VPS providers that do it, but it seems like fun project to have on CV, so I want to try as well.
Let's ignore the front end side of things and focus on the backend.
What do you think is going to be the best approach to do this?
KVM/QEMU or LXC? 
Option 1 Fresh KVM cloud init install with packer provisioning: With cloud init images, i can just change variables like (ssh keys, hostname, CPU core number, RAM...) depending on API request aka customer request.    
          Pros: -Advantage to this would be that I can always pull the latest image (https://cloud- images.ubuntu.com/) without running any update and then just customize all of it with CLI.
          Cons: - Always creating new VM might be a bit bad for performance. 
                    -Also KVM/QEMU takes more resources than LXC
                    -time consuming 

Option 2 Cloning KVM cloud init template and provision with packer: Same as the first step but, i wont use new deploy but just clone template and change variables like SSH keys, cpu core count.. 
            Pros: -faster deploy than option 1. 
            cons: -Again KVM/QEMU takes more resources than LXC 
                      -now I need to create a script of some sort to weekly update this template.

Option 3 Fresh LXC install: 

            Pros:
            Cons:

Option 4 Cloning LXC containers:

            Pros: -faster deploy
            Cons: -again some script for weekly updates
