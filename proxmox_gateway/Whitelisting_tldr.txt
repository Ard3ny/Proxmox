Whitelisting tldr
----------------------------------------------------

Mailproxy -> Whitelist will whitelist senders that would otherwise already get blocked on SMTP level (e.g. missing From: field, RBL list entries etc.)
The Who object -> Whitelist entry will whitelist senders that would e.g. get knocked out by spamassassin/clamav/configured rules etc.
And lastly, there is a third one. Administration -> User -> Whitelist which is a per user whitelist


Below should be the white/blacklist oder.
Mail Filter> Who Objects ...
Administration> User ...
Configuration> Mail Proxy ...
